# **Profile**
Hi all! My name is Yu-Chen Chu. I am a first-year MURP student concentrating in Transportation Policy and Planning. I am from Taiwan and this is the fourth month for me in the US. My undergrad major is Horticulture and Landscape Architecture and I worked as an assistant landscape designer before coming to UCLA. I am interested in the potential and impacts of new mobility, specifically autonomous vehicles, and hope to research in related fields in the future.   

# **Course Description**
This course will train students to critically describe, analyze, and visualize spatial data for planning practices and research, namely creating readable maps for given data. 

# **Project Ideas**
I am interested in the potential and impacts of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs). Project ideas are listed as follows
How SAVs change the commutersâ€™ travel behaviors?
Whether SAVs help reduce the number of vehicles per household, the demand of parking lots, VMT, energy consumption, congestion, GHG emissions
Whether SAVs help improve transportation equality and transit ridership. 
The location to construct systematic SAV service (ex. AV shuttles) that can compensate transit    

# **Objectives**
At the end of this class, I hope that I will be able to master python on analyzing, cleaning, and properly visualizing data; and hopefully to extend the coding skill to other related softwares.
